## Course Description

This course will cover many topics in the plasma physics and astrophysics of black holes and neutron stars, including their multimessenger and multiwavelength electromagnetic signatures. Students will learn the basics of electrodynamics of magnetospheres of compact objects, how they form jets, accretion disks and coronae, and their observational signatures across the electromagnetic spectrum. The course will cover the basics of relativistic kinetic physics, magneto-fluid dynamics, radiation physics and quantum electrodynamics to calculate the plasma dynamics of active galactic nuclei, binaries, pulsars and magnetars. Students will also learn modern numerical techniques, including particle-in-cell algorithms and computational magnetohydrodynamics methods.

There are no official prerequisites for this course, but students will benefit from familiarity with

  * General Relativity
  * Electrodynamics
  * Fluid Dynamics
  * Statistical Physics
  * Thermodynamics 

If you are uncertain whether you have adequate background knowledge for this course, please email the instructors before the beginning of the term.

## Course Work and Grading, Key Dates and Deadlines

There will be 5 assignments throughout the 6 week course. Each assignment will count as an equal fraction of students’ final grades.

Each assignment will consist of a brief summary of a reading and pen-and-paper calculations. Some assignments will include “computational laboratories,” in which students are expected to write code and plot their results. Partial credit will be given, but late assignments will not be accepted without prior approval.

Lecturers will be available during Office Hours once per week and may be contacted over email. See contact information above.
